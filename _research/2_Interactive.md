Co-production of mitigation scenarios through simple IAMs and interactive simulations

Climate Interactive enables everyone to develop their own scenarios of climate solutions with interactive simulation environments 
such as [C-ROADS](https://croadsworldclimate.climateinteractive.org/) and 
[En-ROADS](https://en-roads.climateinteractive.org/scenario.html?v=2.7.39). 

Behind these interactive simulation environments, there are globally aggregate integrated assessment models of climate, energy and economy. 
In the development, maintenance and update of these models, I focus on the [economic impacts of climate change](https://www.climateinteractive.org/analysis/economic-impact-of-climate-change-in-en-roads/) and land-based mitigation options.
