Identifying the vulnerabilities of critical infrastructures

This project at TU Delft, funded by the World Bank, evaluated the vulnerabilities of the Bangladesh's multi-modal transport 
network to climate change, specifically to flood events. 
I contributed to the development of a TCP-based distributed simulation architecture called 
[Sim0MQ](https://sim0mq.org/manual/sim0mq-message-structure/introduction) (based on ZeroMQ messaging library) 
and incorporated it into the model-based scenario analysis software [EMA-Workbench](https://emaworkbench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. 
I also worked on generating georeferenced flood scenarios.
