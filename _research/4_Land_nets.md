Mitigation potential and co-benefits of enhanced weathering

Safe and scalable negative emission technologies (NETs), which actively remove carbon dioxide (CO2) 
from the atmosphere and ensure long-term carbon sequestration will be needed to meet the Paris agreement, 
in addition to conventional climate change mitigation measures. 
Within the [Imbalance-P](http://imbalancep-erc.creaf.cat/) project funded by ERC Synergy Grant 610028, 
I work with collaborators from the [University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/global-change-ecology/) to 
investigate the global mitigation potential and agricultural co-benefits of land-based NETs, particularly enhanced weathering of basalt rock. 
We use the [FeliX model](https://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/researchPrograms/EcosystemsServicesandManagement/Felix_Model.html) 
to explore various future scenarios.
