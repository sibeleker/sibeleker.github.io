A systems view on UK's housing and energy efficiency problems

This project at [UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/environmental-design/hew-integrated-decision-making-about-housing-energy-and-wellbeing) 
was funded by EPSRC Platform Grant on Complex Built Environment Systems (CBES). It facilitated building a stakeholder platform for developoing an integrated view on UK's housing and energy efficiency problem
with a large group of participants from the industry, civil society, academia, and national and local governments.

Within this project, I organized and coordinated the stakeholder workshops, contributed to facilitation of participatory modelling activities, and developed a system dynamics simulation model to understand the mechanisms behind fragmented 
decision making in the UK's  housing sector. We also simplified and converted this simmulation model into an online interactive simulation environment 
<a href="http://www.systo.org/hew_wise.html">(HEW-ISE)</a> to be used in stakeholder workshops.
