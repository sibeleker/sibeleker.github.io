Developing feasible demand-side mitigation scenarios through understanding psychosocial dynamics of lifestyle change

Lifestyle change is an important demand-side measure for climate change mitigation. Referring to a reduction in the carbon footprint of individuals or households in various consumption areas, the mitigation potential of lifestyle change has been mostly assessed in top-down studies that assume a particular rate of reduction in consumption. 
However, whether these rates of change can be achieved or not, and under what conditions, is yet uncertain. 
In this project, I combine integrated assessment modelling with social simulation to investigate a feasible and effective rate of lifestyle change. Feasible adoption rates of low-carbon lifestyles will then lead to feasible demand scenarios for food, energy and material consumption. 
Data-driven (e.g. online social media) social simulation models help to identify the key drivers of such widespread lifestyle changes.

Our work on sustainable diets, which couples the [FeliX integrated assessment model](https://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/researchPrograms/EcosystemsServicesandManagement/Felix_Model.html) with social dynamics has received wide attention, exemplified in this [*commentary*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-019-0354-7)
and the [*editorial*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-019-0366-3). We extended this study on sustainable diets by exploring the usability of social media data across the world to quantify the model on a global scale. A global map showing the interest of the Facebook audience in vegetarianism, as described in [Eker et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/abf770) can be seen [here](https://sibeleker.github.io/map.html).    

We continue using social media data to analyze the drivers of low-carbon lifestyles on a global scale also for the home cooling case.
