Cultivating systems thinking for resilience through participatory system dynamics modelling

The impacts of climate change involve slow-onset changes, extreme events and increasing systemic risks. [EIT Climate-KIC](https://www.climate-kic.org/programmes/deep-demonstrations/resilient-regions/publications/)
takes a systems innovation approach to forging resilience, working with regional governments and city authorities in Andalusia (Spain), 
Nouvelle Aquitaine (France), the Dolomites area (Italy) and Glasgow (UK).

Within the IIASA team, I led the participatory systems modelling activities. 
I introduced the project partners and stakeholders to systems mapping as a tool to understand system interactions and cultivate systems thinking. 
I trained local partners on system dynamics modelling in Nouvelle Aquitaine.
