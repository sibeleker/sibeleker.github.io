Systems thinking to understand national well-being

Measuring well-being has become a major theme in public policy and governance in recent years, 
as researchers and policy makers attempt to unpack what exactly constitutes a "good life". 
In [this project](https://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/researchPrograms/AdvancedSystemsAnalysis/WellBeing.html), together with colleagues from IIASA and  
and National Economic Council of Israel, we developed a conceptual model of natural, economic, and social systems interactions behind national well-being.
 
Based on OECD's [Better Life Index](http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/), designed to measure a nation's progress and welfare beyond conventional metrics such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP),
I specifically worked on how human capital is formed and how it affects national well-being. We identified the interconnections between the OECD indicators following a grounded theory approach 
on academic literature. Hence, it brought a systems thinking perspective to current compartmental well-being measurement approaches.
