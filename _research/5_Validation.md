Making models more credible and useful


With a [two-year fellowship](https://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/education/Sibel_Eker.html) offered by the IIASA Postdoctoral Program, 
I designed and led this project on the validation of uncertainty-oriented systems models. 
I combined the validation approaches from decision sciences and environmental science, and employed an extensive literature analysis 
as well as an online survey conducted among modelling practitioners. Here is a [commentary](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11865-8) about why this work on the validity of policy models is important.
