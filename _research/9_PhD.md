Robust policy options for the transition to a low-carbon energy system


My PhD project was within a large research program called Energy Delta Gas Research (EDGAR), 
funded by the Dutch natural gas production and utility companies, as wells as the Ministries of Internal Affairs and Finance. 

I worked towards providing policy recommendations based on the **robust decision making** framework that acknowledges [deep uncertainties](https://www.deepuncertainty.org/).
Using a system dynamics simulation model I developed to capture the natural, economic and social dimensions of the Dutch energy sector, I explored the plausible futures of the supply and demand dynamics of natural and renewable gas (biomethane), and investigated the effectiveness of various policy options, such as subsidization.
